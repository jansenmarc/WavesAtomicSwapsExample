# WavesAtomicSwapsExample
The Waves Platform will add Smart Contracts (SC) to mainnet in July 2018. While this is a long awaited feature, the
community discusses different use cases that could be implemented on top of SC. One of the most important
use cases are Atomic Swaps (AS). While there is a lot of enthusiasm about AS in the community, very few people dived
into how AS will work. This repository targets an easy to understand example for an AS on the Waves Platform. In order
to keep it simple, the AS swaps Waves against a defined asset. Usually, one of the assets that are swapped would be an
asset on a different blockchain, but the swap protocol could also be performed on one chain, e.g., both assets are
on the Waves blockchain, in order to keep the example easy.
